    "DISCUSSION:\n",
    "The implementation of generators, decorators, and iterators represents a transition from basic scripting to the Advanced Data Structure and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms. Generators and Iterators serve as the foundation for the Advanced Data Structure and Object-Oriented Programming modules. Generators use the yield keyword to process data one item at a time to save memory, while Iterators are class-based objects that provide manual control over data traversal. Decorators explored within the Function and lambda Function module. They \"wrap\" existing functions to add functionality—such as Exception handling, debugging, and logging—without altering the original code structure. In the context of coding conversion, a for loop is a high-level abstraction that automatically manages an iterator, whereas manual iterators allow for granular control during complex data processing. Hence, Generators are vital for Data Science Applications involving large datasets, and Decorators are essential for maintaining clean Python Modules and Package management.\n"

    "CONCLUSION:\n",
    "In this lab, the concepts of iterators, generators, and decorators were studied to understand their roles in Python programming. Finally, iterators and generators allow sequential access to data, with generators providing memory-efficient lazy evaluation. Decorators enable modification of function behavior without changing its code."
